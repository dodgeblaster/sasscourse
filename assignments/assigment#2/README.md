# Configuring Sass

The purpose of this assignment is to give you experience working with someone elses sass code. In this case, we are going to
be working with the sass source code of the Bulma CSS Framework. This is an example of a very large sass project, one that
many people use to kick start their Website Projects. Often developers will build their own css on top of this framework. What
we want to do is actually update styles in the bulma framework sass files.

The starter files can be downloaded [here](https://htmlbasicsresources.s3.amazonaws.com/sass-day-2.zip), and are found in 
the `03_blogAssignment` folder. This is a blog which includes all the sass files from the Bulma Framework.

The assignment is to change the following styles in Bulma's Sass to change the theme or feel of the blog:
- change the font family
- change the background color of the blog and cards
- change the text color
- change the tag background colom
- update the medium hero body padding top to be 12rem instead of 9rem

Each point is worth 1 point, for a total of 5 points.

When changing the colors, it is a good idea to change them based on a theme. One way to choose colors is to use a tool like
[Adobe Kuler](https://color.adobe.com/create). When choosing colors, this tool gives you the following color matching methods:
- Analogous (less tension, therefore harmonous)
- Traid (balanced)
- Complimentary (opposites, therefore more energetic and more tension. Accent colors are often the opposite of the primary color)
- Compound (not as striking as complimentary, not has harmonous as analogous)
