The mocks are wireframes. The design can changed. Feel free to choose a color scheme and add unsplash pictures. Placement of items have to stay the same based on the mocks. Example, on the writers page, having the picture to the left of the text in desktop width, but below the text in mobile width is intentional. 

### Suggested Strategy

The following things should be done before anyone makes a branch on github:

-   1. One person should setup the Git repo and invite all others as collaborators
-   2. One person should setup the project with team conventions, .gitignore, and package.json
-   3. One or more people should decide on the design, color scheme and font
-   4. Once that is decided, one person should setup the sass variables based on the design

Once all of those things are done, it is easy to branch off the master branch
and work on different aspects of the site without too much fear of merge conflicts. For example:

-   1 person could work on the Header for all pages
-   1 person could work on the Footer for all pages
-   1 person could work on 'news card' component
-   1 person could work on the writers component
-   1 person could work on the article page

One suggestion would be to make tasks in Github Projects and have everyone take a task. This will help make sure no one is doing the same thing.
How this assignment will be marked

1. Is there a homepage listing news items articles (based on the mock), a article page (based on the mock), and an writes about page (based on the mock)?
2. Are Sass variables being used?
3. Are Sass styles nested based on component?
4. Are UI components broken out into different Sass files?
5. Is there at least 1 mixin in the project?
6. Is the code free of any merge conflicts?
7. Is the site hosted somewhere (AWS or Netlify or any other service you want to use)?
8. Must have a working mobile menu built with Javascript (you can probably copy the code for this from your js assignment #2)

If your group decides to only do the desktop mocks and fails to make it responsive, you can get a maximum of 90%. If your team also makes it responsive based on the mobile mocks, you will be able to get 100%.
